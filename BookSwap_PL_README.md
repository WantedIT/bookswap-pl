# 📚 BookSwap PL — Student Textbook Marketplace



---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**BookSwap PL** is a web-based marketplace platform where university students can buy and sell second-hand academic textbooks. Built specifically for WSB University students in Dąbrowa Górnicza, the platform connects students who have finished a course (sellers) with students about to start it (buyers).

**Problem solved:** Students pay 400–1500 PLN per semester on textbooks they use for only a few months.  
**Solution:** A campus-specific marketplace that cuts textbook costs by up to 60%.
